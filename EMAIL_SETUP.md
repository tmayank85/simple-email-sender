# Email Sending Setup Instructions

## Current Status
- ✅ Frontend UI is complete
- ❌ Backend email service is not running (currently using mock responses)

## Option 1: Set up Backend Email Service (Recommended)

### Step 1: Install Backend Dependencies
```bash
cd backend-example
npm install
```

### Step 2: Start Backend Service
```bash
npm start
# Or for development with auto-restart:
npm run dev
```

### Step 3: Test the Application
- Backend will run on `http://localhost:3001`
- Frontend will automatically connect to backend
- Real emails will be sent via Gmail SMTP

### Step 4: Gmail Setup
1. Enable 2-Factor Authentication on your Gmail account
2. Go to Google Account Settings → Security → App Passwords
3. Generate an App Password for "Mail"
4. Use the 16-character app password (not your regular Gmail password)

## Option 2: Use Third-Party Email Services

### EmailJS (Browser-based)
- No backend required
- Limited free tier
- Add EmailJS to your React app

### SendGrid API
- Requires API key
- Professional email service
- Need backend or serverless function

### Mailgun API  
- Email service with API
- Good for bulk emails
- Requires backend integration

## Option 3: Deploy with Serverless Functions

### Vercel Functions
```javascript
// api/send-emails.js
const nodemailer = require('nodemailer');

export default async function handler(req, res) {
  // Same email logic as backend-example
}
```

### Netlify Functions
Similar serverless approach with Netlify

## Security Considerations

⚠️ **Important**: Never store email credentials in frontend code!

### Current Implementation:
- ✅ Recipients added to BCC for privacy
- ✅ Email validation
- ✅ Rate limiting (max 25 recipients)
- ❌ Credentials are entered by user (not stored)

### Production Recommendations:
1. Use environment variables for API keys
2. Implement proper authentication
3. Add rate limiting on backend
4. Use HTTPS for all communications
5. Consider OAuth2 instead of app passwords

## Testing the Current App

Right now, the app will:
1. Show a demo message when sending emails
2. Validate form inputs
3. Simulate the email sending process
4. Not actually send real emails (until backend is connected)

To test real email sending:
1. Set up the backend service (Option 1)
2. Start both frontend and backend
3. Use your Gmail credentials with app password
